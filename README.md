# Simple History

This is a JavaScript library to lightly wrap the HTML5 history API, promoting the API
in its most useful form, without a hashchange fallback or trying to fix irrelevant bugs.

If you need an implementation with hashchange fallback, give
[History.js](https://github.com/balupton/History.js/) a try.

## Usage

Before you intialize any relevant event handlers, check if HTML5 history is supported:

    if (SimpleHistory.supported) {
    	// event handlers
    }

When support is available, use `SimpleHistory.start` to notified whenever state changes:

    SimpleHistory.start(function(fragment) {
      // pass to router
    });

That callback is called once immediately, then whenever a state change occurs (push or pop).

To trigger a state change manually, use the `pushState` and `replaceState` methods:

    SimpleHistory.pushState(fragment);
    SimpleHistory.replaceState(fragment);

As with the underlying API, `pushState` adds a history entry, `replaceState` replaces the
current history entry. Use `replaceState` whenever you implement a redirect.

## Roadmap

This library is intended to be kept as simple as it is now. It won't ever support a
hashchange fallback, nor updating `document.title`. If you find an issue, please
file a ticket. Of course, patches (via Pull Requests) are welcome.
